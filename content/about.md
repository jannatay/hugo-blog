# about

I'm Janna and I'm trying to read, write, and learn more. I studied law, politics, and philosophy at university, but literature is my first (and truest) love. I was born in Malaysia but have lived in Auckland since the age of four.

The title of this blog comes from [Zadie Smith's answers](https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/11/zadie-smith-answers-the-proust-questionnaire) to Vanity Fair's question: If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be? *Less cruel.*
