# about

I'm Janna and I'm trying to learn more. I was born in Malaysia and raised in New Zealand.

I studied law, philosophy, and politics at university. I'm in the process of becoming a lawyer and will be starting in 2021 at corporate law firm Allen & Overy. I hope to angle my way into something that touches law, philosophy, and technology, particularly after having spent two years working in legal tech. I wrote two honours dissertations — a shorter one reconfiguring privacy as trust in the context of the Fourth Amendment, and a longer one on whether statutes should be written in code.

That aside, the arts are my first and truest love. I (used to) write poetry and essays all the time; I stopped when the reason I was writing [ran out](https://janna.netlify.app/post/moving-metaphors/), but I'm trying to find my way back to it. I started an [online magazine](http://oscen.co/), I play piano and guitar, and I am trying to get better at photo-taking with my Fujifilm X-T20.
