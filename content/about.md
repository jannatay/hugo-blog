# about

I'm Janna and I'm trying to learn more. I was born in Malaysia, raised in New Zealand, and am currently located in Australia.

I studied law, philosophy, and politics at university. I'm a New Zealand-qualified lawyer and I'm currently at an international corporate law firm. *Mandatory NB: all views here my own.* My experience so far has centred on technology law and many related things, including privacy, intellectual property, and IT. This has spanned general corporate M&A, litigation, and regulatory. Having spent two years prior to this in a legal tech "start-up", I eventually hope to angle my way into something that touches law, philosophy, and technology.

That aside, the arts are my first and truest love. I (used to) write poetry and essays all the time; I stopped when the reason I was writing [ran out](https://janna.netlify.app/post/moving-metaphors/), but I'm trying to find my way back to it. I started an [online magazine](http://oscen.co/), I play piano and guitar, and I am trying to get better at photo-taking with my Fujifilm X-T20.

Check out [some things I've done](https://janna.netlify.app/portfolio/).
