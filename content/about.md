# about

I am an AI & law researcher and a tech & corporate lawyer. Previously at A&O Shearman, currently at the Institute for Law and AI. I care about choosing the right sacrifices, making technology go well, understanding and stewarding the nature of law, and improving human experience. 

I grew up in NZ. I've always lived by the sea. I can ordinarily be found trying to spin some kind of elaborate yarn. 

Currently interested in: 
- The proper functioning and alignment of the body, and how to become a virtuoso of movement. Have spent a lot of time thinking about the shoulder. Moving to the hip soon. 
- Gerald Murnane. Still in the thrall of [*The Plains*](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5615938977). 
- What is legal reasoning? Can we convey the vibe of lawyering to a machine? 
- Time signatures, tempo, and how it is that Adrianne Lenker can play two rhythms on guitar with one hand (and how it is that I could get there myself).
