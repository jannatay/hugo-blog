## The Timeless Way of Building by Christopher Alexander

*A book on how architecture should be done but really is on how to be as human as possible.*

*Finished:* 26 August 2020  
*Rating:* ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

I started reading this because I wanted to learn [how to build](https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/designing-a-new-old-home-part-1-cf298b58ed41) [a house](https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/designing-a-new-old-home-part-2-2a5ea1a1b2b3). That in turn, I thought, seemed like a way to feel closer to the earth and be more aware of its workings. The thesis of the book is that there is one true way of building, and if we adhere to it, then our homes, towns, and communities will come alive with what he terms "the quality without a name". This quality arises when we are able to shed our egos and the images we cling to in order to exert a false sense of order and control. Once we let go of that, a natural order will arise and we will be closer to ‚Äúreality‚Äù on the level that animals live at. We will be able to listen to our most basic human instincts and build our communities and homes according to those. We will build as nature builds: according to broad principles and patterns, but each part will be uniquely shaped for its purpose and place within the whole.

His vision of building is not one of additive parts that comprise a whole, but rather that each part is whole within itself and when it is added to the existing parts, it creates a new whole. I was a few pages in when I realised this wasn't really about architecture, though the application is specific and he details a whole process of planning, construction, and repair. Rather, it's about how we do and should live, how we should interact with nature and our surroundings, what reality is, and a surface-level examination of systems and complexity. I don't know enough about any of those things or architecture to pass judgment on the truth of it, and his skimming of some of the history of building is light and possibly inaccurate. But there's something compelling about the call to strip oneself of all the images and posturing of modern society and return to an existence that is more in tune with nature ‚Äî both the world and human nature.

The book is wonderfully designed with a detailed table of contents with summaries of each chapter, and each chapter contains summary paragraphs in italics throughout which are meant to allow a reader to gather the essence of it in about an hour. That being the case, it feels like book notes are redundant since the book itself contains the notes. Nevertheless, I've set out my own summary and notes below because it kickstarted a particular way of thinking for my life generally.

# Roadmap

This is the way I've grouped the chapters together for myself to explain it not only within the context of the book but as a map of principles for my own life. Alexander has his own part titles, as follows, and I've included his overarching descriptions of each part. The three overarching parts that are my own invention are in italics.

*Meaning of Life*
- **The Timeless Way** ‚Äì Chapter 1
  - "A building or a town will only be alive to the extent that it is governed by the timeless way."
- **The Quality** ‚Äì Chapters 2-8  
  - "To seek the timeless way we must first know the quality without a name."

*Pattern Languages*
- **The Gate** ‚Äì Chapters 9-17
  - "To reach the quality without a name we must then build a living pattern language as a gate."

*Part-to-Whole Relation*
- **The Way** ‚Äì Chapters 18-26
  - "Once we have built the gate, we can pass through it to the practice of the timeless way."
- **The Kernel of the Way** ‚Äì Chapter 27
  - "And yet the timeless way is not complete, and will not fully generate the quality without a name, until we leave the gate behind."

# Meaning of Life

## The Timeless Way

### Chapter 1

Chapter 1 begins to build the grammar of the book. We're introduced to "the timeless way of building", the namesake of this tome and the thing toward which Alexander is leading us.

This timeless way of building:
- is a **process** through which the order of a building or town grows from the inner nature of the people, animals, and plants near it, and
- has the **effect** of allowing the life inside a person, family, and town to flourish so openly that it gives way of its own accord to the natural order needed to sustain this life.

Ultimately, Alexander is saying that the timeless way of building is simply what flows out of us when we allow ourselves to naturally *be* ‚Äî in the sense of what we truly are as part of nature. He considers that the fundamental human instinct is to **complete a world already begun by nature**.

To talk about this, he refers to patterns and processes. These form the major building blocks:
- Every town is made of **patterns**.
- Patterns come from combinatory **processes** which are like languages.

Behind all these processes is a **single common process**. This:
- is **precise** but cannot be used mechanically,
- brings us back to **the part of ourselves we have forgotten**,
- **frees** us from all method,
- is a core so simple and deep that we are **born with it**, and
- builds order out of nothing.

*The beauty, and perhaps frustration, of this book is that each part develops on the last. The description of that single common process sounds like everything and nothing at once. But rather than being a straightforwardly logical sequence, it's more like watching a blurry image of the whole slowly come into focus. By the end, he'll bring it back full circle, and the first sections will make more sense.*

We've obscured this single common process from ourselves by creating artificial **rules and concepts**. With these rules and concepts, we're convinced that we must work within a **system** and with **methods**. As a result, we're afraid of what will happen naturally. Without them, we think everything will become chaos.

However, the artificial images of order distort the nature within us. To free ourselves, we must first learn the discipline of the true relationship between ourselves and our surroundings. This is the **timeless way of building: learning the discipline and shedding it**.

## The Quality

### Chapter 2: The Quality

To seek the timeless way, we must first know the "quality without a name", henceforth "the quality". This is what the timeless way of building will allow us to reveal. It is the root criterion of life and spirit in a person, town, or building. It is the most fundamental quality there is in anything.

A system has this quality when it is **at one with itself**, and is:
- free from inner contradictions,
- true to its inner forces, and  
- at peace with itself.

The effort to become true to oneself is the **central problem of life**. Only those who achieve this are fully "real". Distinguish between those who are true to their inner nature and those who aren't ‚Äî¬†not all of us are equally true or equally real, and not all parts of a system are equally true or equally real.

Thus, not all things are equally alive and real, as physics might tell us. In physics and chemistry, we are taught that what something "is" is entirely separate from what it "ought to be". Alexander implies that this is insufficient, and that what a system "ought to be" grows naturally from what it "is". *This will become clearer, but it all comes from the idea that when we truly "are" ourselves, that is what we "ought to be" because it means we are as real as we possibly can be.*

Freedom from inner contradictions is the very quality **which makes things live**. To be more real is to have a **oneness**. This oneness is the fundamental quality for any thing and embodies everything. *Note that the sense of oneness is consonant with many traditions and practices that give people a sense of meaning in life ‚Äî what comes to mind is the [Platonic model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gH5VIZO0Q&ab_channel=JohnVervaeke) of needing to balance reason, thymos, and the appetites within oneself to reduce inner conflict. And that reduction of inner conflict will allow us to get more in touch with reality and see the right kinds of patterns.*

Alexander then goes on to try and describe the quality with words, and then explains how each of those words are inadequate. It cannot be named but this does not mean it is vague or imprecise ‚Äî it is more precise than any word. Unhelpfully at this point, he says we can only the word to name the quality when we already understand the quality.

What his examination of select words sums to is that the quality encompasses freedom from inner contradictions yet integration within a whole (community, landscape), and is exact in accordance with and resolution of true inner forces while being fluid and free to grow and be filled with life. The quality is, above all, ordinary.

*In other words, the quality is a way of resolving our inner forces and thereby removing our inner contradictions, such that we are both exactly conformed to the free, loose, and life-filled path of our resultant true forms.*

### Chapter 3: Being Alive

Thus, freedom is when all our forces move freely in us. This quality is almost always automatic in nature because there are no **images** to interfere with the natural processes of making things, including the making of ourselves. For humans, however, we have images by which we guide our lives. When these images are artificial and false, they **distort** what we create of ourselves, leading us to bottle up the natural forces within us. We are only free to the extent that we give up those images and the forces within us can then be resolved.

Paradoxically, "being alive" in this manner is not something that can be consciously attained. Instead, it occurs when we forget ourselves completely. These are moments we know only in retrospect. One such example Alexander gives is when we smile unexpectedly. Strangely, despite claiming that "being alive" like this can't be consciously attained, he says we should hold onto such moments and repeat them. Since Alexander's focus is on architecture and buildings, he says we can ask which places made us feel like this ‚Äî¬†his claim is that buildings can create that sense of "being alive" within us. *To extrapolate more widely, this feeling arises from something within our surroundings that allow us to be free.*

### Chapter 4: Patterns of Events

Which is exactly what he says in this chapter: the quality only comes to life in us ‚Äî that is, we are only "alive" ‚Äî when it exists in the world that we are a part of. The quality is **circular**. It exists in us when it exists in our buildings; it exists in our buildings when we have it in ourselves.

So, how do we create it? At what point does "being alive" enter the circle?

Alexander begins by stating that what gives a place its character are the episodes that occur there. These episodes consist of **patterns of events**. The life and soul of a place, and our experiences there, depend on those patterns. Such patterns need not be human ‚Äî¬†for example, the existence of a stream outside one's house can alter the entire experience of the building because of the events and situations it allows one to encounter. This is because it is our situation which allows us to be what we are. *In other words, our environments make us, our particular selves, possible.*

*What I find confusing here, and what I will try to tease apart, is how Alexander defines "patterns". It's the kind of thing that the reader is left to get a feel for without exactly having it pinned down. Here, he seems to indicate that a pattern can be a feature of the environment, and then in the next paragraph, a pattern seems to be a behaviour. But ultimately, a pattern is more like a movement, which I see as broader than human behaviour. And this movement is alive and defined by the features of the environment, by which is meant the space in which it occurs and the structure of that space. Those environmental features can be natural, in which case I think they help to create our culture, but our culture also develops in its own way between humans, and that leads us to create features too. An intertwined cycle.*

What gives a building or a town its character, more specifically, are the **events which recur and which happen there most often**. A person's life is governed by a **small** number of patterns of events which she partakes in repeatedly: having a shower, having breakfast, going to work. It becomes clear that very few patterns are available to us as individuals; days blend into days as we churn through the daily grind. Thus, the effect of those few patterns is huge ‚Äî¬†if they go well, I live well, but if they are bad for me, then I don't live well.

Alexander makes the point that while a person can modify his immediate situations, he cannot go beyond the bounds of the events and patterns of events made available by our **culture**. *If you're familiar with Jordan Peterson, this is almost a flipped phrasing of the 'clean up your room' idea ‚Äî¬†if you can't control the world, you can at least control your own situation and begin with yourself. We are our habits. Alexander's point here takes a similar path in that those daily repetitions shape the vast majority of your life, but writes it large in the context of a building or a city to make the point that those, too, form the few patterns of one's life to great effect.* And the effect is that the ability of the quality to enter our lives depends on the specific nature of these patterns of events from which our world is made.

The patterns of events cannot be separated from the **space** in which they occur. This, however, doesn't mean that space creates or causes events. Alexander gives the example of people on a sidewalk. Being culture-bound, they know that the space which they are part of is a sidewalk, and as part of their culture they have the pattern of the sidewalk in their minds. This pattern tells them to behave a certain way on sidewalks. This is not purely because of the spatial aspect of the concrete and the walls and kerbs, for two sidewalks in different cultures can be interpreted differently. Each sidewalk is a system which includes both the field of geometrical relationships which define its concrete geometry *and* the field of human actions and events which are associated with it. *Patterns are inseparable from space but they aren't the same. To further develop and clarify my earlier explanation ‚Äî¬†Alexander might refer to a particular configuration of features in the environment as a pattern, such as the number of windows in a room, but my understanding is that the pattern is also the kind of life and movement that such features generate. And it may be that whether one thing is pattern or space depends on the perspective ‚Äî¬†for example, the windows can be an environmental feature supporting further patterns, but it can also be a pattern generated out of another environmental feature such as four walls in a room.*

As in nature, there is no distinction between the the stream, its banks, its winding path, the flowing of water, the growth of plants, the swimming of fish. Each is a **living thing**. We can only understand these patterns of events by seeing them as living elements of space themselves. A building or a town is a living system, a collection of interacting and adjacent patterns of events in space. To understand the the life which happens in a building or town, we must try to understand the structure of the space itself.

### Chapter 5: Patterns of Space

Next, Alexander looks at the **fundamental structure** of a building or a town, and how such structure supports or generates certain patterns.

A building or town is made of certain concrete **elements**. Each element is associated with a certain pattern of events. Some physical elements repeat ‚Äî¬†a building is made of walls, doors, and windows, repeated over and over. Alexander suggests that if we change one of those patterns, we can predict what kinds of changes in the patterns of events this change will generate. This chapter addresses the question of how the structure of a space can support the particular patterns of events it does, and how we can make predictions of change. He seeks a theory that clearly presents the interaction of the space and events.
