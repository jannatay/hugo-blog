## Captain Fantastic (2016) dir. Matt Ross

*Anti-capitalist man who raises his kids as philosopher kings must take them into society when their mother dies.*

*Watched:* 9 July 2021  
*Rating:* ★★½☆☆

I first watched this in theatres when it came out, and then rewatched it now five years later to find pouring out of it, unexpectedly, a tangible marker for how much I’d changed. More than anything, this is a personal reflection.

Captain Fantastic follows the story of Ben Cash and the six children that he and his wife Leslie have raised in the (relative) wilderness. Ben and Leslie are so anti-capitalist that it’s almost a caricature — they train their children in survival skills and steep them in left-wing philosophy and politics, quantum physics, literature, and multiple languages. They celebrate Noam Chomsky day instead of Christmas. They hunt what they eat and Ben won’t let them eat processed food.

We meet them at a time when Leslie is absent as she is receiving treatment for depression in hospital. She eventually kills herself, and — against the wishes of her father — Ben takes the kids into society to attend the funeral. They meet their cousins, the oldest son meets a girl, and it becomes evident how unable each of them is to interact with people in the outside world. Indignant at first that the kids should remain with him living as they have been, a series of events force Ben to consider that his way of raising them might not be the safest or the most appropriate.

When I first watched it, I saw myself in these kids who had learned everything from books but had missed the whole world out there that had to be learned through experience. It even extended to things Ben hadn’t realised he knew because they were so innate to him — socially ‘scripted’ exchanges through which trust is built, how to establish rapport with someone else, what Nike is (sneakers, not a Greek god). And yes, maybe everyone is brain dead and you’re superior because you read 19th century literature, but if you’re unable to bridge the gap between you and another person, then what is it all for?

I still resonated with this — even more so, perhaps, having begun to experience over those five years the things I had missed because I spent all my time reading. And I was as emotionally moved in, I suspect, the same places, although the reasons for it have since shifted and, with them, the emphases. It’s strange to age and move through the years as yourself without noticing that anything’s changed. And then to encounter such a situation, look back, and realise you’re seeing the bits and pieces you’d shed somewhere along the way as a whole persona. Someone whom you deeply understand and for whom you feel a fondness, but can’t quite identify with in the same way.

Back then, I found beauty and poignancy in Ben’s endeavour and their forest idyll. I was indignant and joyed at their heist of the funeral, and their success in celebrating Leslie’s life. I was satisfied with the happy equilibrium Ben finds with his kids at the end — sending them to school but living what we might in 2021 call “sustainably”.

Today, I am more skeptical about pretty lighting and the fact that every Sigur Rós song on the soundtrack is a tearjerker. However, I sympathise with the desire to get away from all that frustrates you and begin again. I felt more deeply the love between Ben and Leslie as an experienced thing and not just as a fact.

And now I wonder, on a bigger scale, how sustainable it is reject the world even as you must partake it in. To totally renounce the world based on a political creed seems a naive turn. As a result, Ben’s message is shaky: capitalism is bad and consumerism is bad and institutions are bad so the family escape it. The claim by Leslie’s father that what Ben is doing to the kids is “dangerous” (he lets them climb on roofs and scale rocks in the rain) is dismissed. But when one of his sons Rell defects and refuses to go home, and one of his daughters is injured in a mission Ben devises to bring Rell home, Ben reconsiders. He returns to society and puts them in the schools he’s always abhorred. Where is the equivalence in that?

Presumably he’s putting their health and safety first, and coming to the realisation that he needs to socially integrate his kids. While relatively able in the wilderness (that’s not so far from town as to be inaccessible), he and Leslie appear to have grown up in cities. Leslie’s father is wealthy and owns a huge estate. Their dream was to raise their children as philosopher kings in a situation akin to camping. And indeed it was an idyll — there was no true danger. You’d think that in teaching people survival skills you’d be equally prepared, in principle, to accept death and permanent injury as a risk.

The flaw in Ben’s philosophy was that it perverted reality. He and Leslie created a dream world that was unsustainable. While pitched as a return to “nature”, they lived too beautifully and only enhanced that which they wished to enhance — they didn’t have to acknowledge the harsh realities of survival, the base features of human nature that contributed so much to the ugliness they branded with the shallow label of “capitalism”. And it also led Ben to confuse what was truly abhorrent with what was truly human. He is angry when his oldest son Bo goes behind his back to apply for college in order to partake in these corrupt institutions, but he fails to understand that Bo is simply seeking friendship, companionship, belonging, a wider horizon of experience — all very human things.

But I think the only true redemption from that is to reexamine the philosophy under which one lives. Ben doesn’t do that. It's hinted that Leslie might have begun questioning things because she’s the one who helps Bo with his college applications. Some family members say she was unhappy and wanted to leave. Then her mother tells Ben she was happy again in the forest. And then all of it is sort of swept aside with the explanation that she had bipolar disorder and was manic-depressive. Although I doubt it would’ve been dealt with, I wish more had been made of Leslie than her operation as a plot device.

However, it seems that Ben only changes their lives because of the physical risk he poses to them and so that they can learn how to not be freaks in a normal social interaction. The kids go to school and their house just looks like an organic bulk foods shop with chickens. But it makes me wonder: what then for the rest of their lives? How do they reconcile that extreme renunciation of the world with their reintegration now? On a deeper level, it doesn’t appear that Ben can help them to handle that dissonance because he never resolves it for himself in a way that is philosophically sound. There is no real understanding — and this is where the film fails for me — of what they're actually seeking: true humanness.
