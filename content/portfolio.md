### oscen

[Oscen](https://oscen.co/) is a magazine focused on uplifting marginalised voices. I co-founded it with a few friends and have been Editor-in-Chief since 2018.

I created the concept of each of the issues: Authenticity, Power, and Myths. I review and edit submissions, coordinate design and marketing, and write copy and manage social media according to a tight timeline. I created, branded, and wrote original features, including interviews that I conducted and reviews of shows. Along the way, I learned copywriting, design, audio editing, photography, photo editing, coding, Wordpress, SEO, social media, and more.

We built relationships with key organisations and individuals within the New Zealand arts world. We received regular invitations to collaborate on events and review shows from organisations such as [Proudly Asian Theatre](http://www.proudlyasiantheatre.com/), [Artspace](https://artspace-aotearoa.nz/), and  [Satellites](https://www.instagram.com/aksatellites/).

Our design was done by a friend of mine, [Zoe Hu](http://zoehu.co/), who also built the website and its theme.

### merulae

![Merulae1](/images/Merulae1.png)

Like all angst-ridden teens in the 2010s, I had multiple Tumblr accounts. [merulae](https://merulae.tumblr.com) was my literature-specific one, where I posted and continue to post quotes from the fiction, poetry, and philosophy I read. I used to post everyday, and now will post only a few times a month but it still continues to enjoy nearly 5,000 followers and counting.

### anthems for a twenty two year-old woman

![Nanthems2](/images/Nanthems2.png)

[This project](https://nanthems.tumblr.com/) was a site I built on Tumblr from scratch using HTML and CSS. It was a half-finished birthday gift for a friend who turned 22 in which I had begun writing short pieces based on songs that were meaningful to us. The title comes from Broken Social Scene's iconic indie song [Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJYbIZmOEEA), as explained [here](https://nanthems.tumblr.com/about).
